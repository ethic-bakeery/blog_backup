# Introduction

![A hand holding a magnifying glass](path/to/image.jpg)

This room focuses on the offensive security tool **Gobuster**, often used for reconnaissance. We will explore how this tool can enumerate web directories, subdomains, and virtual hosts. This room will follow a hands-on approach where you can follow along with the commands explained and execute them yourself to see the results.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the basics of enumeration
- How to use Gobuster to enumerate web directories and files
- How to use Gobuster to enumerate subdomains
- How to use Gobuster to enumerate virtual hosts
- How to use a wordlist

### Environment and Setup
For this room, we will use an Ubuntu 20.04 VM acting as a web server. This web server hosts multiple subdomains and vhosts. The web server also has two content management systems (CMS) installed. These are Wordpress and Joomla.

Throughout this room, we will be using the AttackBox, where Gobuster is already installed, to enumerate the web server directories and subdomains. However, if you prefer to use your own machine instead of the AttackBox, you must be connected to the TryHackMe VPN and have Gobuster installed. You can find installation instructions for Gobuster on your own machine in the official Gobuster GitHub repository.

You can start the web server by clicking the Start Machine button below. The VM will take approximately 2 minutes to boot up. Direct access to this web server is not required. To start the AttackBox, click the Start AttackBox button at the top of the page.

### Start Machine
Important: We work in a local network with a DNS server on the web server. To ensure we can resolve the domains used throughout this room, you need to change the /etc/systemd/resolved.conf file:

- Open up a terminal on the the AttackBox and enter the command: sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.
- Remove the # in front of DNS= and add  MACHINE_IP after it.
- Save the file by pressing CTRL+O, followed by pressing ENTER, and then exit the editor by pressing CTRL+X.
- Enter the command sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved.
- The file should look something like this:

```bash
root@tryhackme:~# cat /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
[Resolve]
DNS=MACHINE_IP
#FallbackDNS=
#Domains=
#LLMNR=no
#MulticastDNS=no
```
## Gobuster: Introduction
Gobuster is an open-source offensive tool written in Golang. It enumerates web directories, DNS subdomains, vhosts, Amazon S3 buckets, and Google Cloud Storage by brute force, using specific wordlists and handling the incoming responses. Many security professionals use this tool for penetration testing, bug bounty hunting, and cyber security assessments. Looking at the phases of ethical hacking, we can place Gobuster between the reconnaissance and scanning phases.

Before exploring Gobuster, let’s briefly discuss the concepts of enumeration and Brute Force.

### Enumeration

Enumeration is the act of listing all the available resources, whether they are accessible or not. For example, Gobuster enumerates web directories.

### Brute Force

Brute force is the act of trying every possibility until a match is found. It is like having ten keys and trying them all on a lock until one fits. Gobuster uses wordlists for this purpose.

### Gobuster: Overview
Gobuster is included by default in distributions like Kali Linux. Let’s start by looking at Gobuster’s help page. This help page gives us a good overview of its functionalities and options.

Enter the following command: gobuster --help. You should get the help page for the Gobuster tool as shown below:

```bash 
AttackBox Terminal
root@tryhackme:~# gobuster --help
Usage:
  gobuster [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  dir         Uses directory/file enumeration mode
  dns         Uses DNS subdomain enumeration mode
  fuzz        Uses fuzzing mode. Replaces the keyword FUZZ in the URL, Headers and the request body
  gcs         Uses gcs bucket enumeration mode
  help        Help about any command
  s3          Uses aws bucket enumeration mode
  tftp        Uses TFTP enumeration mode
  version     shows the current version
  vhost       Uses VHOST enumeration mode (you most probably want to use the IP address as the URL parameter)

Flags:
      --debug                 Enable debug output
      --delay duration        Time each thread waits between requests (e.g. 1500ms)
  -h, --help                  help for gobuster
      --no-color              Disable color output
      --no-error              Don't display errors
  -z, --no-progress           Don't display progress
  -o, --output string         Output file to write results to (defaults to stdout)
  -p, --pattern string        File containing replacement patterns
  -q, --quiet                 Don't print the banner and other noise
  -t, --threads int           Number of concurrent threads (default 10)
  -v, --verbose               Verbose output (errors)
  -w, --wordlist string       Path to the wordlist. Set to - to use STDIN.
      --wordlist-offset int   Resume from a given position in the wordlist (defaults to 0)

Use "gobuster [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Usage
This section shows the syntax on how to use the command.

### Available Commands
Gobuster offers multiple commands to aid in enumerating directories, files, DNS subdomains, Google Cloud Storage buckets, and Amazon AWS S3 buckets. In this room, we will focus on the `dir`, `dns`, and `vhost` commands.

### Flags
These are specific options we can configure to customize our commands. Below are the flags we will often use throughout this room:

| Short Flag | Long Flag            | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -t         | --threads            | Configures the number of threads for the scan (default is 10). Adjust based on system resources; more threads can speed up scanning.                |
| -w         | --wordlist           | Specifies the path to the wordlist used for iterating through URLs.                                                                                |
| --delay    |                      | Sets the time to wait between requests to avoid detection by web servers monitoring request frequency.                                               |
| --debug    |                      | Enables debug output to assist in troubleshooting unexpected errors.                                                                                |
| -o         | --output             | Directs Gobuster to write enumeration results to a specified output file.        

### Example
Let us look at an example of how we would use these commands and flags together to enumerate a web directory:

gobuster dir -u "http://www.example.thm/" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -t 64
gobuster dir indicates that we will use the directory and file enumeration mode.
- u "http://www.example.thm/" tells Gobuster that the target URL is http://example.thm/.
- w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt directs Gobuster to use the small.txt wordlist to brute force the web directories. Gobuster will use each entry in the wordlist to form a new URL and send a GET request to that URL. If the first entry of the wordlist were images, Gobuster would send a GET request to http://example.thm/images/.
- t 64 sets the number of threads Gobuster will use to 64. This improves the performance drastically.
Now that we have a quick overview of Gobuster, let’s explore the different modes and their use cases in the following tasks.                                                                  |


- What flag to we use to specify the target URL?
-u

- What command do we use for the subdomain enumeration mode?
dns
