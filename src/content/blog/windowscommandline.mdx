## Introduction to Windows Command Line

Many users prefer graphical user interfaces (GUIs) until they become proficient with command-line interfaces (CLIs). While GUIs are often intuitive, CLIs, once mastered, can be much faster and more efficient for various tasks. For example, finding your IP address can require multiple clicks in a GUI, while a simple command can achieve the same result in the CLI without removing your hands from the keyboard.

### Advantages of Using a CLI

- **Lower Resource Usage**: CLIs require fewer system resources, making them suitable for older hardware or systems with limited memory. This is particularly advantageous in cloud computing environments.
  
- **Automation**: Automating tasks with a CLI is simpler through batch files or scripts, allowing for efficient repetition of commands.

- **Remote Management**: CLIs facilitate remote management using SSH, which is effective even on slow networks and systems with limited resources.

### Learning Objectives

This room aims to teach you how to use MS Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe), the default command-line interpreter in Windows, to:

- Display basic system information
- Check and troubleshoot network configuration
- Manage files and folders
- Check running processes

### Room Prerequisites

Before starting this room, ensure you have completed the Windows and Active Directory Fundamentals module.

### Starting the AttackBox

1. Press the **Start Machine** button to launch the AttackBox.
2. The AttackBox will appear in Split-Screen view. If not, click the **Show Split View** button.

### Establishing an SSH Connection

To connect to the target machine (MACHINE_IP) from the AttackBox, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal in the AttackBox.
2. Use the command: `ssh user@MACHINE_IP`.
3. Trust the connection by typing "yes" when prompted.
4. Enter the password: `Tryhackme123!` (note that it won't display while typing).

This introduction sets the stage for mastering the Windows Command Line and highlights its benefits and functionalities.

## Basic System Information
MS Windows computer screen saying Hi to the user.Before issuing commands, we should note that we can only issue the commands within the Windows Path. You can issue the command set to check your path from the command line. The terminal output below shows the path where MS Windows will execute commands, as indicated by the line starting with Path=.
![systeminfo]](/tryhackme/Cyber-Security-101/windows-cmd/icon.png)
```cmd
C:\>set
ALLUSERSPROFILE=C:\ProgramData
[...]
LOGNAME=strategos
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=2
OS=Windows_NT
Path=C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\;C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;C:\Users\strategos\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;
[...]
```
Let’s use the ver command to determine the operating system (OS) version. The terminal below shows an example output.

```cmd
Terminal
C:\>ver                                                                                                                                              
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]
```

Enough warming up. Let’s discover more in-depth information about the system. We can run the systeminfo command to list various information about the system such as OS information, system details, processor and memory. The terminal below shows a snippet of the displayed output.

```cmd
C:\>systeminfo

Host Name:                 WIN-SRV-2019
OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Datacenter
OS Version:                10.0.17763 N/A Build 17763
OS Manufacturer:           Microsoft Corporation
OS Configuration:          Standalone Server
OS Build Type:             Multiprocessor Free
[...]
```
Before moving on, it is good to mention a couple of tricks.First, you can pipe it through more if the output is too long. Then, you can view it page after page by pressing the space bar button. To demonstrate this, try running driverquery and compare it with running driverquery | more. In the latter, you can display the output page by page and you can exit it using CTRL + C.

- help - Provides help information for a specific command
- cls - Clears the Command Prompt screen.

## Network Troubleshooting
Most of us are used to looking up MS Windows network configuration from the GUI interface. The command-line interface provides many networking-related commands to look up your current configuration, check ongoing connections, and troubleshoot networking issues.

### Network Configuration
You can check your network information using ipconfig. The terminal output below shows our IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

<Info>ipconfig is a command in Windows used to view and manage the network settings of your computer. It displays information such as the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for your network adapters. This command is especially helpful for diagnosing network issues, as it allows users to see how their system is configured</Info>

```cmd
C:\>ipconfig

Windows IP Configuration

Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : eu-west-1.compute.internal
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::90df:4861:ba40:f2a8%4
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.230.237
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.0.1
```
# Windows IP Configuration

- **Connection-specific DNS Suffix**: This is the DNS suffix that gets appended to unqualified hostnames for DNS resolution. It can help the system locate the appropriate DNS server for resolving names.

- **Link-local IPv6 Address**: This is an IPv6 address used for communication within the local network segment. It’s automatically assigned and is not routable beyond the local network.

- **IPv4 Address**: This is the unique IP address assigned to the network adapter, allowing it to communicate on an IPv4 network.

- **Subnet Mask**: This determines the network segment the IP address belongs to, helping to identify which part of the address is the network and which part is the host.

- **Default Gateway**: This is the IP address of the router that the computer uses to access external networks, including the internet. It acts as an exit point from the local network.

You can also use ipconfig /all for more information about your network configuration. As shown in the terminal below, we can view our DNS servers and confirm that DHCP is enabled.

```cmd
C:\>ipconfig /all

## Ethernet Adapter: Ethernet 3

- **Connection-specific DNS Suffix**: This DNS suffix is used to resolve unqualified hostnames within the specified domain.

- **Description**: Indicates the type of network adapter, in this case, an Amazon Elastic Network Adapter.

- **Physical Address**: The MAC address of the network adapter, which uniquely identifies it on the network.

- **DHCP Enabled**: Indicates whether the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is enabled for the adapter.

- **Autoconfiguration Enabled**: Shows if automatic IP address configuration is enabled for the adapter.

- **Link-local IPv6 Address**: The IPv6 address used for communication within the local network segment; it is automatically assigned.

- **IPv4 Address**: The unique IP address assigned to the adapter for communication on an IPv4 network.

- **Subnet Mask**: Defines the network segment of the IP address, indicating which part is the network and which part is the host.

- **Lease Obtained**: The date and time when the DHCP lease was acquired.

- **Lease Expires**: The date and time when the DHCP lease will expire, after which a new lease must be obtained.

- **Default Gateway**: The IP address of the router used to access external networks, including the internet.

- **DHCP Server**: The IP address of the DHCP server that assigned the IP address and other configurations.

- **DHCPv6 IAID**: Identifier for the DHCPv6 client, used for identifying the client in DHCP communications.

- **DHCPv6 Client DUID**: A unique identifier for the DHCPv6 client, allowing the DHCP server to identify the client.

- **DNS Servers**: The IP addresses of the DNS servers used for resolving domain names to IP addresses.

- **NetBIOS over Tcpip**: Indicates whether NetBIOS is enabled for the TCP/IP protocol, facilitating legacy networking applications.

### Network Troubleshooting
One common troubleshooting task is checking if the server can access a particular server on the Internet. The command syntax is ping target_name. Inspired by ping-pong, we send a specific ICMP packet and listen for a response. If a response is received, we know that we can reach the target and that the target can reach us.

Let’s find out if we reach example.com. In the terminal output below, we can see that we have successfully received four replies. Furthermore, we got some statistics; for instance, the average round trip time is 78 milliseconds.

```cmd
C:\>ping example.com

Pinging example.com [93.184.215.14] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 93.184.215.14: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=52
Reply from 93.184.215.14: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=52
Reply from 93.184.215.14: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=52
Reply from 93.184.215.14: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=52

Ping statistics for 93.184.215.14:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 78ms, Maximum = 78ms, Average = 78ms
Another valuable tool for troubleshooting is tracert, which stands for trace route. The command tracert target_name traces the network route traversed to reach the target. Without getting into more details, it expects the routers on the path to notify us if they drop a packet because its time-to-live (TTL) has reached zero. The terminal output below shows that we passed through 15 routers before reaching our target.
```
<Info>ping is a network utility that checks the reachability of a host on a network. It works by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages to the specified IP address or hostname and waits for Echo Reply messages in return. This process helps determine if the host is online and measures the round-trip time for packets, providing insights into network performance. Additionally, it can detect packet loss, which may indicate connectivity issues. Overall, ping is a straightforward tool for diagnosing network problems.</Info>

```cmd
C:\>tracert example.com

<Info>`tracert` (or `traceroute` on other systems) is a command-line utility that tracks the route packets take from your computer to a specified destination. It identifies each hop along the path, providing information about the intermediate devices and the time taken for each segment of the journey. This helps diagnose network latency or connectivity issues. </Info>

More Networking Commands
One networking command worth knowing is nslookup. It looks up a host or domain and returns its IP address. The syntax nslookup example.com will look up example.com using the default name server; however, nslookup example.com 1.1.1.1 will use the name server one.one.one.one. The terminal below shows the output of both commands. The results are identical; however, you can see that the answers were retrieved from different name servers.

```cmd
C:\>nslookup example.com
Server:  ip-10-0-0-2.eu-west-1.compute.internal
Address:  10.0.0.2

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    example.com
Addresses:  2606:2800:21f:cb07:6820:80da:af6b:8b2c
          93.184.215.14

C:>nslookup example.com 1.1.1.1
Server:  one.one.one.one
Address:  1.1.1.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    example.com
Addresses:  2606:2800:21f:cb07:6820:80da:af6b:8b2c
          93.184.215.14
```
<Info>`nslookup` is a command-line tool used to query Domain Name System (DNS) servers to retrieve information about domain names or IP addresses. It allows users to find the IP address associated with a domain name or vice versa, making it useful for diagnosing DNS issues and verifying DNS records. </Info>

The final networking command we will cover in this room is netstat. This command displays current network connections and listening ports. A basic netstat command with no arguments will show you established connections, as shown below. In this case, we only have one SSH connection; we figured out it is SSH because it is bound to port 22.

```cmd
C:\>netstat

Active Connections

  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State
  TCP    10.10.230.237:22       ip-10-11-81-126:53486  ESTABLISHED
  ```
If you are curious about the other options, you can run netstat -h, where -h displays the help page. We opted for the following options:

- a displays all established connections and listening ports
- b shows the program associated with each listening port and established connection
- o reveals the process ID (PID) associated with the connection
- n uses a numerical form for addresses and port numbers
We combine these four options and execute the netstat -abon command. The result is quite long, but we display the first few lines in the terminal below. It is clear now that the executable sshd.exe is responsible for listening for incoming connections on port 22, as shown in the first line. We can also see the process ID (PID) associated with each connection.

```cmd
C:\>netstat -abon

Active Connections

  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State           PID 
  TCP    0.0.0.0:22             0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       2116
 [sshd.exe]
  TCP    0.0.0.0:135            0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       820

  TCP    0.0.0.0:49669          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       2036
 [spoolsv.exe]
  TCP    0.0.0.0:49670          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       584

  TCP    0.0.0.0:49686          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       592
 [lsass.exe]
  TCP    10.10.230.237:22       10.11.81.126:53486     ESTABLISHED     2116 
 [sshd.exe]

## File and Disk Management
You have learned to look up basic system information and check the network configuration. Now, let’s discover how to browse the directories and move files around.

Working With Directories
You can use cd without parameters to display the current drive and directory. It is the equivalent of asking the system, where am I?

You can view the child directories using dir.

```cmd 
C:\Users\strategos>cd
C:\Users\strategos

C:\Users\strategos>dir 
 Volume in drive C has no label. 
 Volume Serial Number is A8A4-C362

 Directory of C:\Users\strategos

05/01/2024  02:40 PM    <DIR>          .
05/01/2024  02:40 PM    <DIR>          ..
11/14/2018  06:56 AM    <DIR>          Desktop
05/01/2024  02:40 PM    <DIR>          Documents
09/15/2018  07:19 AM    <DIR>          Downloads
09/15/2018  07:19 AM    <DIR>          Favorites
09/15/2018  07:19 AM    <DIR>          Links
09/15/2018  07:19 AM    <DIR>          Music
09/15/2018  07:19 AM    <DIR>          Pictures
09/15/2018  07:19 AM    <DIR>          Saved Games
09/15/2018  07:19 AM    <DIR>          Videos
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
              11 Dir(s)  14,984,953,856 bytes free
```
Note that you can use the following options with dir:

```cmd 
dir /a - Displays hidden and system files as well.
dir /s - Displays files in the current directory and all subdirectories.
```
You can type tree to visually represent the child directories and subdirectories.

```cmd 
C:\Users\strategos>tree
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is A8A4-C362
C:.
├───Desktop
├───Documents
├───Downloads
├───Favorites
├───Links
├───Music
├───Pictures
├───Saved Games
└───Videos
```
You can change to any directory by using the command cd target_directory; this is equivalent to double-clicking the target_directory on your desktop. Furthermore, you can use cd .. to go up one level. An example is shown in the terminal output below.

```cmd
C:\>cd
C:\

C:\>cd Users

C:\Users>cd 
C:\Users 

C:\Users>cd .. 

C:\>cd 
C:\ 
To create a directory, use mkdir directory_name; mkdir stands for make directory. To delete a directory, use rmdir directory_name; rmdir stands for remove directory. The terminal output below shows creating and deleting a directory.

Terminal
C:\example>mkdir backup_files

strategos@WIN-SRV-2019 C:\example>dir
 Directory of C:\example

05/02/2024  07:36 AM    <DIR>          .
05/02/2024  07:36 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/02/2024  07:36 AM    <DIR>          backup_files
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  14,984,724,480 bytes free

C:\example>rmdir backup_files

C:\example>dir 
 Directory of C:\example

05/02/2024  07:36 AM    <DIR>          .
05/02/2024  07:36 AM    <DIR>          ..
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  14,984,724,480 bytes free
Working With Files
```
You are working with the command line. You are curious about the contents of a particular text file. You can easily view text files with the command type. This command will dump the contents of the text file on the screen; this is convenient for files that fit within your terminal window. You might want to consider more for longer text files. This command will display enough text file contents to fill your terminal window. In other words, for long text files, more will display a single page and wait for you to press Spacebar to move by one page (flip the page) or Enter to move by one line.

The copy command allows you to copy files from one location to another. The following terminal output provides an example.

```cmd
C:\example>dir
 Directory of C:\example

05/02/2024  08:12 AM    <DIR>          .
05/02/2024  08:12 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test.txt
               1 File(s)             17 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  14,983,409,664 bytes free

C:\example>copy test.txt test2.txt
        1 file(s) copied.

C:\example>dir
 Directory of C:\example

05/02/2024  08:12 AM    <DIR>          .
05/02/2024  08:12 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test.txt
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test2.txt
               2 File(s)             34 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  14,983,409,664 bytes free
```

Similarly, you can move files using the move command. An example is shown in the terminal output below.

```cmd
C:\example>dir
 Directory of C:\example

05/02/2024  08:12 AM    <DIR>          .
05/02/2024  08:12 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test.txt
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test2.txt
               2 File(s)             34 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  14,983,409,664 bytes free

C:\example>move test2.txt .. 
        1 file(s) moved. 

C:\example>dir 
 Directory of C:\example

05/02/2024  08:13 AM    <DIR>          .
05/02/2024  08:13 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test.txt
               1 File(s)             17 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  14,983,409,664 bytes free
```
Finally, we can delete a file using del or erase.

```cmd
C:\example>dir
 Directory of C:\example

05/02/2024  08:16 AM    <DIR>          .
05/02/2024  08:16 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test.txt
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test2.txt
               2 File(s)             34 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  14,983,409,664 bytes free

C:\example>erase test2.txt

C:\example>dir 
 Directory of C:\example

05/02/2024  08:16 AM    <DIR>          .
05/02/2024  08:16 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/02/2024  07:57 AM                17 test.txt
               1 File(s)             17 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  14,983,409,664 bytes free
```
We can use the wildcard character * to refer to multiple files. For example, copy *.md C:\Markdown will copy all files with the extension md to the directory C:\Markdown.

to obtain the flag of this section,go to your cmd 
```cmd 
dir C:\Treasure\Hunt 
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 5448-D41F

 Directory of C:\Treasure\Hunt

08/20/2024  01:54 PM    <DIR>          .
08/20/2024  01:54 PM    <DIR>          ..
08/20/2024  01:54 PM                18 flag.txt
               1 File(s)             18 bytes
               2 Dir(s)   9,171,963,904 bytes free

## Task and Process Management
You must be familiar with MS Windows Task Manager and might be familiar with killing non-responsive processes. Let’s discover how to achieve a similar functionality using the command line.

We can list the running processes using tasklist.

```cmd
C:\>tasklist

Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage 
========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
System Idle Process              0 Services                   0          8 K
System                           4 Services                   0         88 K
Registry                        84 Services                   0     50,700 K
smss.exe                       276 Services                   0      1,132 K
csrss.exe                      372 Services                   0      5,264 K
wininit.exe                    448 Services                   0      6,892 K
csrss.exe                      456 Console                    1      5,028 K
winlogon.exe                   516 Console                    1     11,144 K
services.exe                   584 Services                   0      7,492 K
lsass.exe                      592 Services                   0     16,108 K
svchost.exe                    704 Services                   0     23,432 K
fontdrvhost.exe                736 Console                    1      4,256 K
[...]
```
Some filtering is helpful because the output is expected to be very long. You can check all available filters by displaying the help page using tasklist /?. Let’s say that we want to search for tasks related to sshd.exe, we can do that with the command tasklist /FI "imagename eq sshd.exe". Note that /FI is used to set the filter image name equals sshd.exe.

```cmd
C:\>tasklist /FI "imagename eq sshd.exe"

Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage
========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
sshd.exe                      2116 Services                   0      6,992 K
sshd.exe                      2712 Services                   0      7,668 K
sshd.exe                      4752 Services                   0      7,372 K
```

With the process ID (PID) known, we can terminate any task using taskkill /PID target_pid. For example, if we want to kill the process with PID 4567, we would issue the command taskkill /PID 4567.

## Conclusion

In this room, we focused on the most practical commands for accessing a networked system over the command line.

We intentionally omitted a few common commands as we didn’t see a real value for including them in a beginner room. We mention them below so that you know that the command line can be used for other tasks:

- **chkdsk**: Checks the file system and disk volumes for errors and bad sectors.
- **driverquery**: Displays a list of installed device drivers.
- **sfc /scannow**: Scans system files for corruption and repairs them if possible.

It is important to remember all the commands covered in the previous tasks; moreover, it is equally important to know that `/?”` can be used with most commands to display a help page.

In this room, we used the command `more` in two ways:

1. **Display text files**: `more file.txt`
2. **Pipe long output to view it page by page**: `some_command | more`

Equipped with this knowledge, we now know how to display the help page of a new command and how to display long output one page at a time.

Now that you know the Windows command line, it is time to move to the Windows PowerShell room.

To answer the questions in this section, lets have a look at `shutdown --help` output

```cmd 
user@WINSRV2022-CORE C:\Users\user>shutdown --help
Usage: shutdown [/i | /l | /s | /sg | /r | /g | /a | /p | /h | /e | /o] [/hybrid] [/soft] [/fw] [/f]
    [/m \\computer][/t xxx][/d [p|u:]xx:yy [/c "comment"]]

    No args    Display help. This is the same as typing /?.
    /?         Display help. This is the same as not typing any options.
    /i         Display the graphical user interface (GUI).
               This must be the first option.
    /l         Log off. This cannot be used with /m or /d options.
    /s         Shutdown the computer.
    /sg        Shutdown the computer. On the next boot, if Automatic Restart Sign-On
               is enabled, automatically sign in and lock last interactive user.
               After sign in, restart any registered applications.
    /r         Full shutdown and restart the computer.
    /g         Full shutdown and restart the computer. After the system is rebooted,
               if Automatic Restart Sign-On is enabled, automatically sign in and
               lock last interactive user.
               After sign in, restart any registered applications.
    /a         Abort a system shutdown.
               This can only be used during the time-out period.
               Combine with /fw to clear any pending boots to firmware.
    /p         Turn off the local computer with no time-out or warning.
               Can be used with /d and /f options.
    /h         Hibernate the local computer.
               Can be used with the /f option.
    /hybrid    Performs a shutdown of the computer and prepares it for fast startup.
               Must be used with /s option.
    /fw        Combine with a shutdown option to cause the next boot to go to the
               firmware user interface.
    /e         Document the reason for an unexpected shutdown of a computer.
    /o         Go to the advanced boot options menu and restart the computer.
               Must be used with /r option.
    /m \\computer Specify the target computer.
    /t xxx     Set the time-out period before shutdown to xxx seconds.
               The valid range is 0-315360000 (10 years), with a default of 30.
               If the timeout period is greater than 0, the /f parameter is
               implied.
    /c "comment" Comment on the reason for the restart or shutdown.
               Maximum of 512 characters allowed.
    /f         Force running applications to close without forewarning users.
               The /f parameter is implied when a value greater than 0 is
               specified for the /t parameter.
    /d [p|u:]xx:yy  Provide the reason for the restart or shutdown.
               p indicates that the restart or shutdown is planned.
               u indicates that the reason is user defined.
               If neither p nor u is specified the restart or shutdown is
               unplanned.
               xx is the major reason number (positive integer less than 256).
               yy is the minor reason number (positive integer less than 65536).
Failed to get retrieve reasons.
